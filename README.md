## Features

- User registration & login (JWT-based authentication)
- Role-based access (user, admin)
- Vehicle CRUD (add, update, view, delete)
- Booking lifecycle (create, view, cancel, complete)
- Search & filtering for vehicles (by brand, model, availability, location)
- Price calculation and availability checking
- Input validation and error handling
- Pagination for large result sets
- Secure handling of sensitive data (credentials, tokens)

## Tech Stack

- Language: (inferred repository composition) — please check repo for the exact language (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Flask/FastAPI, Java/Spring Boot)
- Authentication: JWT
- Database: Relational DB (Postgres/MySQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB) — see project config
- Migrations: (e.g., Sequelize / TypeORM / Alembic / Flyway) — see repository
- Testing: Unit & integration tests (framework depends on language)
- Optional: Docker for local dev and deployment

> Note: Update the above with the exact stack after confirming code details in the repo.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Node.js >= 14 / Python 3.8+ / Java 11+ (depending on implementation)
- Package manager (npm/yarn/pip/gradle/maven)
- Database server (Postgres / MySQL / MongoDB)
- Optional: Docker & Docker Compose (if a docker-compose is provided)

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file at the project root (copy from `.env.example` if present) and set the following values:

- APP_PORT=3000
- NODE_ENV=development
- DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/carrental_db
- JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
- JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
- EMAIL_SERVICE_HOST=...
- EMAIL_SERVICE_USER=...
- EMAIL_SERVICE_PASS=...
- CLOUD_STORAGE_URL=...
- Other service keys (Stripe, S3, etc.) if used by the project

Adjust names and keys to match what's required in the repository.

### Install & Run Locally

Example instructions for a Node.js app (adapt if different):

1. Clone the repo
   git clone https://github.com/krHimanshu123/carrental-backend.git
   cd carrental-backend

2. Install dependencies
   npm install

3. Set environment variables
   cp .env.example .env
   # edit .env to add DB credentials and secrets

4. Run database migrations (if applicable)
   npm run migrate

5. Start the app
   npm run dev
   # or for production
   npm start

6. The API should be available at:
   http://localhost:3000 (or the port set in APP_PORT)

Replace scripts above with the exact commands in package.json or project build files.

## Database

- Create the database defined in your DATABASE_URL.
- Run migrations and seeders if provided:
  - Example: npm run migrate && npm run seed
- If using Docker, there may be a docker-compose.yml to spin up DB + app.

Refer to /migrations and /seeders (or corresponding folder) for schema and sample data.

## API Overview

This section gives a high-level overview of the major endpoints. Replace paths and payloads with exact definitions from the repository's route files or API docs.

Authentication
- POST /auth/register
  - Body: { name, email, password }
  - Response: created user summary
- POST /auth/login
  - Body: { email, password }
  - Response: { token, user }

User
- GET /users/me
  - Auth: Bearer token
  - Returns current authenticated user

Vehicles
- GET /vehicles
  - Params: page, limit, brand, model, minPrice, maxPrice, location, availableFrom, availableTo
- GET /vehicles/:id
- POST /vehicles (admin)
- PUT /vehicles/:id (admin)
- DELETE /vehicles/:id (admin)

Bookings
- POST /bookings
  - Body: { vehicleId, startDate, endDate, paymentMethod }
- GET /bookings (user/admin sees their or all bookings)
- GET /bookings/:id
- PATCH /bookings/:id/cancel
- PATCH /bookings/:id/complete (admin)

Price & Availability
- GET /vehicles/:id/availability?start=YYYY-MM-DD&end=YYYY-MM-DD
- GET /pricing/estimate?vehicleId=...&start=...&end=...

Errors
- Consistent error response format:
  {
    "status": "error",
    "message": "Descriptive message",
    "errors": [ ...optional field errors... ]
  }

Authentication
- Most routes require Bearer JWT token.
- Admin-only routes check role claim inside the token.

API Documentation
- If present, check `/docs` or Swagger/OpenAPI (e.g., `/api-docs`) for full schema.

## Testing

- Unit tests: npm run test
- Integration tests: npm run test:integration
- Linting: npm run lint
- Coverage: npm run coverage

Adjust commands to the test setup in repository. Aim for tests that cover booking flow, availability checks, and auth.

## Development Tips

- Use Postman / Insomnia to test endpoints. Import OpenAPI spec if available.
- When changing DB schema, add migrations and update seed data.
- Ensure JWT secrets & API keys are never committed — use .env and .gitignore.
- Add validation at controller/input layer and centralized error handling.

## Deployment

Common options:
- Docker: Build image and push to registry; run in ECS, GKE, or a VM.
- Managed Platform: Heroku, Render, Railway (set env vars and provisioning DB).
- CI/CD: Add GitHub Actions to run tests, build, and deploy on push to main.

Example Docker steps:
- docker build -t car-rental-backend:latest .
- docker run -e DATABASE_URL=... -p 3000:3000 car-rental-backend:latest
